Sure, I can provide you with an example of a Java web application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for adding two numbers. Here is a basic example:

Model:

The model represents the data and business logic of the application. In this case, the model will contain a method for adding two numbers.
```
public class CalculatorModel {
    public int addNumbers(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}

```
Controller:

The controller is responsible for processing user input, interacting with the model to update data, and returning the appropriate view. In this case, the controller will receive the user input (the two numbers to be added) from the view, pass them to the model to perform the addition, and then return the result to the view.
```
public class CalculatorController {
    private CalculatorModel model;
    public CalculatorController(CalculatorModel model) {
        this.model = model;
    }
    public int addNumbers(int num1, int num2) {
        return model.addNumbers(num1, num2);
    }
}

```
View:

The view is responsible for displaying the user interface and taking input from the user. In this case, the view will have two input fields for the user to enter the two numbers to be added and a button to submit the form. When the user submits the form, the controller will be called to perform the addition and return the result, which will then be displayed on the page.
```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Calculator</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Addition</h1>
        <form method="post">
            <input type="text" name="num1" placeholder="Enter first number" />
            <input type="text" name="num2" placeholder="Enter second number" />
            <input type="submit" value="Add" />
        </form>
        <%
            if (request.getMethod().equals("POST")) {
                int num1 = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("num1"));
                int num2 = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("num2"));
                CalculatorModel model = new CalculatorModel();
                CalculatorController controller = new CalculatorController(model);
                int result = controller.addNumbers(num1, num2);
                out.println("<h2>Result: " + result + "</h2>");
            }
        %>
    </body>
</html>

```
In this example, the view is implemented using JSP (JavaServer Pages), but it could also be implemented using other frameworks such as Thymeleaf, JSF, or Spring MVC.

When the user submits the form, the controller is instantiated and passed the model. The controller then calls the `addNumbers` method on the model with the two numbers entered by the user, and returns the result. The result is then displayed on the page using the `out.println` method.

Note that this is a very basic example and does not include error handling or input validation, which would be necessary in a real-world application.

Certainly! Let me break down those three lines of code for you:



`CalculatorModel model = new CalculatorModel();` 

This line creates a new instance of the `CalculatorModel` class, which is the model component in our MVC architecture. We need to create an instance of the model in order to use its methods, which in this case is the `addNumbers()` method that will add the two numbers together.



`CalculatorController controller = new CalculatorController(model);` 

This line creates a new instance of the `CalculatorController` class, which is the controller component in our MVC architecture. The `CalculatorController` constructor takes an instance of the `CalculatorModel` class as a parameter, which is why we need to create an instance of the model first. This line essentially associates the model with the controller, so that the controller can access the model's methods to perform the necessary business logic.



`int result = controller.addNumbers(num1, num2);` 

This line calls the `addNumbers()` method on the `CalculatorController` instance we created earlier, passing in the two numbers `num1` and `num2` that the user entered. The `addNumbers()` method, in turn, calls the `addNumbers()` method on the `CalculatorModel` instance that we passed in earlier, which actually performs the addition of the two numbers. The result of this addition is then returned back to the `CalculatorController`, which returns it to the view for display.

So in summary, these three lines of code create the necessary instances of the `CalculatorModel` and `CalculatorController` classes, associate them with each other, and then use them to perform the addition of the two numbers that the user entered.
